The best-known types of malware, viruses and worms, are known for the manner in which they spread, rather than any specific types of behavior. A computer virus is software that embeds itself in some other executable software (including the operating system itself) on the target system without the user's knowledge and consent and when it is run, the virus is spread to other executables. On the other hand, a worm is a stand-alone malware software that actively transmits itself over a network to infect other computers. These definitions lead to the observation that a virus requires the user to run an infected software or operating system for the virus to spread, whereas a worm spreads itself.
A computer virus is a type of malicious software that, when executed, replicates itself by modifying other computer programs and inserting its own code.When this replication succeeds, the affected areas are then said to be infected with a computer virus.
A computer virus is software usually hidden within another seemingly innocuous program that can produce copies of itself and insert them into other programs or files, and that usually performs a harmful action (such as destroying data).[18] An example of this is a PE infection, a technique, usually used to spread malware, that inserts extra data or executable code into PE files.
A computer worm is a standalone malware computer program that replicates itself in order to spread to other computers.Often, it uses a computer network to spread itself, relying on security failures on the target computer to access it. Worms almost always cause at least some harm to the network, even if only by consuming bandwidth, whereas viruses almost always corrupt or modify files on a targeted computer.
Many worms are designed only to spread, and do not attempt to change the systems they pass through. However, as the Morris worm and Mydoom showed, even these payload-free worms can cause major disruption by increasing network traffic and other unintended effects.
Trojans are generally spread by some form of social engineering, for example where a user is duped into executing an e-mail attachment disguised to appear not suspicious, (e.g., a routine form to be filled in), or by clicking on some fake advertisement on social media or anywhere else . Although their payload can be anything, many modern forms act as a backdoor, contacting a controller which can then have unauthorized access to the affected computer.
A Trojan horse is a harmful program that misrepresents itself to masquerade as a regular, benign program or utility in order to persuade a victim to install it. A Trojan horse usually carries a hidden destructive function that is activated when the application is started. The term is derived from the Ancient Greek story of the Trojan horse used to invade the city of Troy by stealth.
Ransomware is a type of malicious software from cryptovirology that threatens to publish the victim's data or perpetually block access to it unless a ransom is paid. While some simple ransomware may lock the system in a way which is not difficult for a knowledgeable person to reverse, more advanced malware uses a technique called cryptoviral extortion, in which it encrypts the victim's files, making them inaccessible, and demands a ransom payment to decrypt them.
Ransomware attacks are typically carried out using a Trojan that is disguised as a legitimate file that the user is tricked into downloading or opening when it arrives as an email attachment. However, one high-profile example, the WannaCry worm, traveled automatically between computers without user interaction.
Spyware is software that aims to gather information about a person or organization, sometimes without their knowledge, that may send such information to another entity without the consumer's consent, that asserts control over a device without the consumer's knowledge, or it may send such information to another entity with the consumer's consent, through cookies.
Spyware is mostly used for the purposes of tracking and storing Internet users' movements on the Web and serving up pop-up ads to Internet users. Whenever spyware is used for malicious purposes, its presence is typically hidden from the user and can be difficult to detect. Some spyware, such as keyloggers, may be installed by the owner of a shared, corporate, or public computer intentionally in order to monitor users.
Adware, or advertising-supported software, is software that generates revenue for its developer by automatically generating online advertisements in the user interface of the software or on a screen presented to the user during the installation process. The software may generate two types of revenue: one is for the display of the advertisement and another on a pay-per-click basis, if the user clicks on the advertisement. The software may implement advertisements in a variety of ways, including a static box display, a banner display, full screen, a video, pop-up ad or in some other form.
Adware is unwanted software designed to throw advertisements up on your screen, most often within a web browser. Some security professionals view it as the forerunner of the modern-day PUP (potentially unwanted program). Typically, it uses an underhanded method to either disguise itself as legitimate, or piggyback on another program to trick you into installing it on your PC, tablet, or mobile device.
A rootkit is a collection of computer software, typically malicious, designed to enable access to a computer or areas of its software that is not otherwise allowed (for example, to an unauthorized user) and often masks its existence or the existence of other software. The term rootkit is a concatenation of root (the traditional name of the privileged account on Unix-like operating systems) and the word kit (which refers to the software components that implement the tool). The term rootkit has negative connotations through its association with malware.
Rootkits can prevent a harmful process from being visible in the systems list of processes, or keep its files from being read.
A backdoor is a method, often secret, of bypassing normal authentication or encryption in a computer system, a product, or an embedded device (e.g. a home router), or its embodiment, e.g. as part of a cryptosystem, an algorithm, a chipset, or a homunculus computer —a tiny computer-within-a-computer (such as that as found in Intel's AMT technology). Backdoors are often used for securing remote access to a computer, or obtaining access to plaintext in cryptographic systems.
A backdoor may take the form of a hidden part of a program, a separate program (e.g. Back Orifice may subvert the system through a rootkit), code in the firmware of the hardware, or parts of an operating system such as Windows. Trojan horses can be used to create vulnerabilities in a device. A Trojan Horse may appear to be an entirely legitimate program, but when executed, it enacts an activity that may install a backdoor. Although some are secretly installed, other backdoors are deliberate and widely known. These kinds of backdoors have legitimate uses such as providing the manufacturer with a way to restore user passwords. The backdoor may be used to gain access to passwords, delete data on hard drives, or transfer information within the cloud.

Malware has become a catchall term for various types of cyber security risks, such as viruses, Trojan horses, worms, adware, ransomware and spyware. Many of us use these terms interchangeably to describe strange symptoms or behaviors encountered on a computer. However, all of them share a common goal, which is to compromise the safety of your devices. Symptoms of malware may appear obvious or discrete; knowing how to detect these dangerous intrusions will help you determine how to go about fixing the problem should it ever occur.
Malware is short for malicious software and refers to programs specifically engineered to compromise the security features on a computer, allowing people to comb through your personal data and, in some cases, commit identify theft.
If this sounds like something you want to avoid, join the club! Nobody wants malware on their computer. Learning to be proactive about your computer’s security features is the best way to avoid a malware intrusion. But first, let’s take a look at a few red flags that can indicate a malware problem:
Signs of Malware
Most of the time, the presence of malware will be obvious even though you might not know how it got on your device. In fact, most people have no idea that malware has been installed until their computers start acting funny.
You might notice a few changes on your computer including strange ads or pop-up windows—even when you’re not surfing the web. You may also experience unwanted changes to your browser and a slower experience on your computer.
Specifically, watch out for ads that pop up a few seconds after a webpage is done loading. These ads will often contain inappropriate content, are difficult to close, and display flashing colors while blocking what you’re trying to view.
Take all of these signs seriously. If you suspect your computer has malware installed, turn it off immediately and disconnect it from the Internet.
How Did I Get Malware?
Malware is usually installed unintentionally as a result a few missteps taken by the user.
Malware can be installed accidentally by clicking on a link and hidden or masked by another software. This often happens when users download content from unknown or untrustworthy sources. Seemingly harmless downloads, like screen savers, toolbars, and torrents, are likely suspects.
Another reason you might find malware on your computer is because you neglected to update your anti-virus/malware software, operating system or other programs on your computer. Updating your security features is just as important as having them in the first place. If you don’t have quality anti-virus or anti-spyware installed on your computer, you’re at a higher risk of malware intrusion.
Malware, like a virus, can agitate problems exponentially. In other words, once you get malware on your computer, it may trigger more intrusions, which trigger more malware installs. The best thing to do is nip the problem in the bud as soon as you see any signs of malware.
How to Avoid Malware
Computer security almost always begins with anti-virus/malware software. While this advice may be obvious to some, many home computers don’t have proper security software installed. Make this a priority on your home computer; it’s the best thing you can to do to avoid malware. Run periodic diagnostic scans with your anti-virus/malware software. You can set it up so the program runs scans automatically during regular intervals. Run a malware detection scan at least once a week, preferably at night so you won’t need to use the computer. Additionally, you should be aware of your behavior online. Clicking on dubious-looking advertisements or websites can be like opening a floodgate. If your gut is telling you something looks or feels suspicious, don’t click on it. Finally, you should always keep your personal information safe with encryption firewalls, either on the modem or each individual computer, and protect accounts with complex, unique passwords. Stay proactive with your cyber security and be vigilant while using the Internet.
Depending on how comfortable you are with computers, you may want to seek professional help to remove any viruses or malware. Alternatively, there are step-by-step instructions available for both PC and Mac if you prefer to do it yourself.
Malware, short for "malicious software," refers to a type of computer program designed to infect a legitimate user's computer and inflict harm on it in multiple ways. Malware can infect computers and devices in several ways and comes in a number of forms, just a few of which include viruses, worms, Trojans, spyware and more. It's vital that all users know how to recognize and protect themselves from malware in all of its forms.

So what is malware? It comes in a bewildering variety of forms. Computer viruses are probably the most familiar type of malware — so named because they spread by making copies of themselves. Worms have a similar property. Other types of malware, such as spyware, are named for what they do: In the case of spyware, it transmits personal information, such as credit card numbers.
So after asking "What is malware?" the next logical questions are, "who is creating it, and why?" The days when most malware was created by teenage pranksters are long gone. Malware today is largely designed by and for professional criminals.
These criminals may employ a variety of sophisticated tactics. In some cases, as technology site Public CIO notes, cybercriminals have even "locked up" computer data — making the information inaccessible — then demanded ransom from the users to get that data back.
But the main risk that cybercriminals pose to heavy computer users is stealing online banking information such as banking and credit card accounts and passwords. The criminal hackers who steal this information may then use it to drain your account or run up fraudulent credit card bills in your name. Or they may sell your account information on the black market, where this confidential information fetches a good price.
So now we're at the biggest question of all: "How do I make sure my computer or network is malware-free?"
The answer has two parts: Personal vigilance, and protective tools. One of the most popular ways to spread malware is by email, which may be disguised to look as if it is from a familiar company such as a bank, or a personal email from a friend.
Be wary of emails that ask you to provide passwords. Or emails that seem to be from friends, but have only a message such as "check out this cool website!" followed by a link.
Personal vigilance is the first layer of protection against malware, but simply being careful is not enough. Because business security is not perfect, even downloads from legitimate sites can sometimes have malware attached. Which means that even the most prudent user is at risk, unless you take additional measures.

Malware is short for malicious software, meaning software that can be used to compromise computer functions, steal data, bypass access controls, or otherwise cause harm to the host computer. Malware is a broad term that refers to a variety of malicious programs. This post will define several of the most common types of malware; adware, bots, bugs, rootkits, spyware, Trojan horses, viruses, and worms.
Adware (short for advertising-supported software) is a type of malware that automatically delivers advertisements. Common examples of adware include pop-up ads on websites and advertisements that are displayed by software. Often times software and applications offer “free” versions that come bundled with adware. Most adware is sponsored or authored by advertisers and serves as a revenue generating tool. While some adware is solely designed to deliver advertisements, it is not uncommon for adware to come bundled with spyware (see below) that is capable of tracking user activity and stealing information. Due to the added capabilities of spyware, adware/spyware bundles are significantly more dangerous than adware on its own.
Bots are software programs created to automatically perform specific operations. While some bots are created for relatively harmless purposes (video gaming, internet auctions, online contests, etc), it is becoming increasingly common to see bots being used maliciously. Bots can be used in botnets (collections of computers to be controlled by third parties) for DDoS attacks, as spambots that render advertisements on websites, as web spiders that scrape server data, and for distributing malware disguised as popular search items on download sites. Websites can guard against bots with CAPTCHA tests that verify users as human.
In the context of software, a bug is a flaw produces an undesired outcome. These flaws are usually the result of human error and typically exist in the source code or compilers of a program. Minor bugs only slightly affect a program’s behavior and as a result can go for long periods of time before being discovered. More significant bugs can cause crashing or freezing. Security bugs are the most severe type of bugs and can allow attackers to bypass user authentication, override access privileges, or steal data. Bugs can be prevented with developer education, quality control, and code analysis tools.
Ransomware is a form of malware that essentially holds a computer system captive while demanding a ransom. The malware restricts user access to the computer either by encrypting files on the hard drive or locking down the system and displaying messages that are intended to force the user to pay the malware creator to remove the restrictions and regain access to their computer. Ransomware typically spreads like a normal computer worm (see below) ending up on a computer via a downloaded file or through some other vulnerability in a network service.
A rootkit is a type of malicious software designed to remotely access or control a computer without being detected by users or security programs. Once a rootkit has been installed it is possible for the malicious party behind the rootkit to remotely execute files, access/steal information, modify system configurations, alter software (especially any security software that could detect the rootkit), install concealed malware, or control the computer as part of a botnet. Rootkit prevention, detection, and removal can be difficult due to their stealthy operation. Because a rootkit continually hides its presence, typical security products are not effective in detecting and removing rootkits. As a result, rootkit detection relies on manual methods such as monitoring computer behavior for irregular activity, signature scanning, and storage dump analysis. Organizations and users can protect themselves from rootkits by regularly patching vulnerabilities in software, applications, and operating systems, updating virus definitions, avoiding suspicious downloads, and performing static analysis scans.
Spyware is a type of malware that functions by spying on user activity without their knowledge. These spying capabilities can include activity monitoring, collecting keystrokes, data harvesting (account information, logins, financial data), and more. Spyware often has additional capabilities as well, ranging from modifying security settings of software or browsers to interfering with network connections. Spyware spreads by exploiting software vulnerabilities, bundling itself with legitimate software, or in Trojans.
A Trojan horse, commonly known as a “Trojan,” is a type of malware that disguises itself as a normal file or program to trick users into downloading and installing malware. A Trojan can give a malicious party remote access to an infected computer. Once an attacker has access to an infected computer, it is possible for the attacker to steal data (logins, financial data, even electronic money), install more malware, modify files, monitor user activity (screen watching, keylogging, etc), use the computer in botnets, and anonymize internet activity by the attacker.
A virus is a form of malware that is capable of copying itself and spreading to other computers. Viruses often spread to other computers by attaching themselves to various programs and executing code when a user launches one of those infected programs. Viruses can also spread through script files, documents, and cross-site scripting vulnerabilities in web apps. Viruses can be used to steal information, harm host computers and networks, create botnets, steal money, render advertisements, and more.
Computer worms are among the most common types of malware. They spread over computer networks by exploiting operating system vulnerabilities. Worms typically cause harm to their host networks by consuming bandwidth and overloading web servers. Computer worms can also contain “payloads” that damage host computers. Payloads are pieces of code written to perform actions on affected computers beyond simply spreading the worm. Payloads are commonly designed to steal data, delete files, or create botnets. Computer worms can be classified as a type of computer virus, but there are several characteristics that distinguish computer worms from regular viruses. A major difference is that computer worms have the ability to self-replicate and spread independently while viruses rely on human activity to spread (running a program, opening a file, etc). Worms often spread by sending mass emails with infected attachments to users’ contacts.
Spam is the electronic sending of mass unsolicited messages. The most common medium for spam is email, but it is not uncommon for spammers to use instant messages, texting, blogs, web forums, search engines, and social media. While spam is not actually a type of malware, it is very common for malware to spread through spamming. This happens when computers that are infected with viruses, worms, or other malware are used to distribute spam messages containing more malware. Users can prevent getting spammed by avoiding unfamiliar emails and keeping their email addresses as private as possible.

1. Viruses
A computer virus is what most of the media and regular end-users call every malware program reported in the news. Fortunately, most malware programs aren't viruses. A computer virus modifies other legitimate host files (or pointers to them) in such a way that when a victim's file is executed, the virus is also executed.
Pure computer viruses are uncommon today, comprising less than 10 percent of all malware. That's a good thing: Viruses are the only type of malware that "infects" other files. That makes them particularly hard to clean up because the malware must be executed from the legitimate program. This has always been nontrivial, and today it's almost impossible. The best antivirus programs struggle with doing it correctly and in many (if not most) cases will simply quarantine or delete the infected file instead.
2. Worms
Worms have been around even longer than computer viruses, all the way back to mainframe days. Email brought them into fashion in the late 1990s, and for nearly a decade, computer security pros were besieged by malicious worms that arrived as message attachments. One person would open a wormed email and the entire company would be infected in short order.
The distinctive trait of the worm is that it's self-replicating. Take the notorious Iloveyou worm: When it went off, it hit nearly every email user in the world, overloaded phone systems (with fraudulently sent texts), brought down television networks, and even delayed my daily afternoon paper for half a day. Several other worms, including SQL Slammer and MS Blaster, ensured the worm's place in computer security history.
What makes an effective worm so devastating is its ability to spread without end-user action. Viruses, by contrast, require that an end-user at least kick it off, before it can try to infect other innocent files and users. Worms exploit other files and programs to do the dirty work. For example, the SQL Slammer worm used a (patched) vulnerability in Microsoft SQL to incur buffer overflows on nearly every unpatched SQL server connected to the internet in about 10 minutes, a speed record that still stands today.
3. Trojans
Computer worms have been replaced by Trojan horse malware programs as the weapon of choice for hackers. Trojans masquerade as legitimate programs, but they contain malicious instructions. They've been around forever, even longer than computer viruses, but have taken hold of current computers more than any other type of malware.
A Trojan must be executed by its victim to do its work. Trojans usually arrive via email or are pushed on users when they visit infected websites. The most popular Trojan type is the fake antivirus program, which pops up and claims you're infected, then instructs you to run a program to clean your PC. Users swallow the bait and the Trojan takes root.
Trojans are hard to defend against for two reasons: They're easy to write (cyber criminals routinely produce and hawk Trojan-building kits) and spread by tricking end-users — which a patch, firewall, and other traditional defense cannot stop. Malware writers pump out Trojans by the millions each month. Antimalware vendors try their best to fight Trojans, but there are too many signatures to keep up with.
4. Hybrids and exotic forms
Today, most malware is a combination of traditional malicious programs, often including parts of Trojans and worms and occasionally a virus. Usually the malware program appears to the end-user as a Trojan, but once executed, it attacks other victims over the network like a worm.
Many of today's malware programs are considered rootkits or stealth programs. Essentially, malware programs attempt to modify the underlying operating system to take ultimate control and hide from antimalware programs. To get rid of these types of programs, you must remove the controlling component from memory, beginning with the antimalware scan.
Bots are essentially Trojan/worm combinations that attempt to make individual exploited clients a part of a larger malicious network. Botmasters have one or more "command and control" servers that bot clients check into to receive their updated instructions. Botnets range in size from a few thousand compromised computers to huge networks with hundreds of thousands of systems under the control of a single botnet master. These botnets are often rented out to other criminals who then use them for their own nefarious purposes.
5. Ransomware
Malware programs that encrypt your data and hold it as hostage waiting for a cryptocurrency pay off has been a huge percentage of the malware for the last few years, and the percentage is still growing. Ransomware has often crippled companies, hospitals, police departments, and even entire cities.
Most ransomware programs are Trojans, which means they must be spread through social engineering of some sort. Once executed, most look for and encrypt users’ files within a few minutes, although a few are now taking a “wait-and-see” approach. By watching the user for a few hours before setting off the encryption routine, the malware admin can figure out exactly how much ransom the victim can afford and also be sure to delete or encrypt other supposedly safe backups.
Ransomware can be prevented just like every other type of malware program, but once executed, it can be hard to reverse the damage without a good, validated backup. According to some studies, about a quarter of the victims pay the ransom, and of those, about 30 percent still do not get their files unlocked. Either way, unlocking the encrypted files, if even possible, takes particular tools, decryption keys and more than a bit of luck. The best advice is to make sure you have a good, offline backup of all critical files.
6. Fileless malware
Fileless malware isn’t really a different category of malware, but more of a description of how they exploit and persevere. Traditional malware travels and infects new systems using the file system. Fileless malware, which today comprises over 50 percent of all malware and growing, is malware that doesn’t directly use files or the file system. Instead they exploit and spread in memory only or using other “non-file” OS objects such as registry keys, APIs or scheduled tasks.
Many fileless attacks begin by exploiting an existing legitimate program, becoming a newly launched “sub-process,” or by using existing legitimate tools built into the OS (like Microsoft’s PowerShell). The end result is that fileless attacks are harder to detect and stop. If you aren’t already very familiar with common fileless attack techniques and programs, you probably should be if you want a career in computer security.
7. Adware
If you're lucky, the only malware program you've come in contact with is adware, which attempts to expose the compromised end-user to unwanted, potentially malicious advertising. A common adware program might redirect a user's browser searches to look-alike web pages that contain other product promotions.
8. Spyware
Spyware is most often used by people who want to check on the computer activities of loved ones. Of course, in targeted attacks, criminals can use spyware to log the keystrokes of victims and gain access to passwords or intellectual property.
Adware and spyware programs are usually the easiest to remove, often because they aren't nearly as nefarious in their intentions as other types of malware. Find the malicious executable and prevent it from being executed — you're done.
A much bigger concern than the actual adware or spyware is the mechanism it used to exploit the computer or user, be it social engineering, unpatched software, or a dozen other root exploit causes. This is because although a spyware or adware program’s intentions are not as malicious, as say, a backdoor remote access trojan, they both use the same methods to break in. The presence of an adware/spyware program should serve as a warning that the device or user has some sort of weakness that needs to be corrected, before real badness comes calling.

This list of Malware types only scratches the surface in that Malware is being developed by those trying to gain access to your computer for monetary gain. The list of Malware types focuses on the most common and the general categories of infection
Adware:. The least dangerous and most lucrative Malware. Adware displays ads on your computer.
Spyware:. Spyware is software that spies on you, tracking your internet activities in order to send advertising (Adware) back to your system.
Virus: A virus is a contagious program or code that attaches itself to another piece of software, and then reproduces itself when that software is run. Most often this is spread by sharing software or files between computers.
Worm: A program that replicates itself and destroys data and files on the computer. Worms work to “eat” the system operating files and data files until the drive is empty.
Trojan: The most dangerous Malware. Trojans are written with the purpose of discovering your financial information, taking over your computer’s system resources, and in larger systems creating a “denial-of-service attack ” Denial-of-service attack: an attempt to make a machine or network resource unavailable to those attempting to reach it. Example: AOL, Yahoo or your business network becoming unavailable.
Rootkit: This one is likened to the burglar hiding in the attic, waiting to take from you while you are not home. It is the hardest of all Malware to detect and therefore to remove; many experts recommend completely wiping your hard drive and reinstalling everything from scratch. It is designed to permit the other information gathering Malware in to get the identity information from your computer without you realizing anything is going on.
Backdoors: Backdoors are much the same as Trojans or worms, except that they open a “backdoor” onto a computer, providing a network connection for hackers or other Malware to enter or for viruses or SPAM to be sent.
Keyloggers: Records everything you type on your PC in order to glean your log-in names, passwords, and other sensitive information, and send it on to the source of the keylogging program. Many times keyloggers are used by corporations and parents to acquire computer usage information.  
Rogue security software: This one deceives or misleads users. It pretends to be a good program to remove Malware infections, but all the while it is the Malware. Often it will turn off the real Anti-Virus software. The next image shows the typical screen for this Malware program, Antivirus 2010
Ransomware: If you see this screen that warns you that you have been locked out of your computer until you pay for your cybercrimes. Your system is severely infected with a form of Malware called Ransomware. It is not a real notification from the FBI, but, rather an infection of the system itself. Even if you pay to unlock the system, the system is unlocked, but you are not free of it locking you out again. The request for money, usually in the hundreds of dollars is completely fake.
Browser Hijacker:  When your homepage changes to one that looks like those in the images inserted next, you may have been infected with one form or another of a Browser Hijacker. This dangerous Malware will redirect your normal search activity and give you the results the developers want you to see. Its intention is to make money off your web surfing. Using this homepage and not removing the Malware lets the source developers capture your surfing interests. This is especially dangerous when banking or shopping online. These homepages can look harmless, but in every case they allow other more infectious 

Running into the word that starts with mal is a literal sign that something is bad. In general, most experts view the term malware as a contraction of two words — malicious software. The word has bad connotations by deliberate construction, but the actual psychology of malware is a little less clear cut.
That’s because there is a whole range of malicious software that you can encounter on your computing journey, with new types and categories of threats emerging, as the world moves toward a digital future.
So much so that viruses are now just the tip of the iceberg.
Recent studies say that the majority of the malicious software out there in the wild today is Trojans and worms, with viruses having declined in numbers. A 2011 study had Trojan horses amount to 69.99% of all malware tracked, while viruses only made up 16.82%. This is a number that has clearly gone up.
A more recent study in 2017 found that malware aimed at mobile devices like smartphones and tablets is increasing at an alarming late, and even coming pre-installed on devices.
But what are the various types of malware, and how exactly are they classified?
Let’s see how attackers install and deploy these types of threats, as well as a few infamous and destructive examples of these types of malware.
1. Viruses
Viruses have been around since the dawn of time — speaking in computer terms, that is. In fact, computing luminary John von Neumann did the first academic work on the theory of self-replicating computer programs all the way back in 1949. The first examples of what can be classified as a virus have been detected since the 70s.
The primary characteristic that a piece of software must possess to qualify as a virus is an urge to reproduce that is programmed into it. This mechanism means that this type of malware will distribute copies of itself, using any means to spread. Another characteristic common to viruses is that they are covert, making it hard to detect their presence on a system, without dedicated security programs called antivirus.
Essentially, they arrive uninvited, hide in secrecy and usually work in obscurity.
And that is what makes them so deadly.
They hide within computer files, and the computer must run that file (execute that code, in other words) for a virus to do its dirty work. At its core, a virus is nothing but a contagious code or program that attaches itself to other software and usually requires human interaction to propagate. This is how viruses are further classified, depending on whether they reside in binary executables, data files, or in the boot sector of a hard drive of a particular system.
1a. System or boot infectors
A virus can infect a system as a resident virus by installing itself as part of the operating system, so that it remains in the RAM from the time a computer is booted up to when it is shutdown. These types of viruses are very rare these days, what with the advent of the Internet, and security procedures built into modern operating systems like Windows 10.
2a. File infectors
Many viruses sneak up into ordinary executable files like .EXE and .COM in order to up their chances of being run by a user. Any program that file type that Windows can call for execution is susceptible, including batch and script files like .BAT, .JS. .VB, and even screensaver files with the .SCR extension.
3a. Macro viruses
These types of viruses are the ones that run inside specific applications that allow macro programs in order to extend the capabilities of a given software. Viruses that targeted Microsoft Office were widespread a few years back, though the threat of macro viruses has also declined in recent times as unsigned macros are automatically disabled in Office and are not allowed to run.
What is Browser Hijacker
Many users install antivirus software that can detect and eliminate known viruses, and also prevent infections when the computer attempts to download or run the executable files that are either downloaded from the Internet, or distributed as email attachments, or on USB flash drives. This means that the antivirus software needs to be regularly updated in order to recognize the latest threats, as cybercriminals continue to create new viruses.
And although their threat may have diminished in recent years, and other forms of malware may have taken the spotlight, viruses have been the cause of widespread destruction, as they replicate and perform activities like accessing sensitive information, stealing data, and most of all, consuming system resources like CPU and disk space, crippling the systems, often rendering them useless.
Some infamous examples of viruses over the years are the Concept virus, the Chernobyl virus (also known as CIH), the Anna Kournikova virus, Brain and RavMonE.exe.
2. Worms
The second of the two types of infectious malware. A worm is a standalone software that replicates without targeting and infecting specific files that are already present on a computer. Think of worms as small programs that replicate themselves in a computer and destroy the files and data on it. They usually target the operating system files, and work until the drive they are in becomes empty.
Basically, whereas viruses add themselves inside existing files, worms carry themselves in their own containers.
Worms usually show up via email and instant messages, and often confine themselves their activities to what they can accomplish inside the application that moves them. They use a computer network to spread, relying on security failures on the target computer in order to access it, and delete data.
Many worms that have been created are designed only to spread, and do not attempt to change the systems that they pass through. But even these have unintended effects can cause major disruptions by increasing the network traffic.
Examples include Melissa, Morris, Mydoom, Sasser, Blaster, and Mylife.
3. Trojan Horses
A Trojan is a malicious program that misrepresents itself to appear useful. These are spread in the guise of routine software that persuade a victim to install it on their PC. The term is derived from the Ancient Greek story of the wooden horse that was used to invade the city of Troy by stealth — Trojan horses are just as deadly on computers.
The payload can be anything, but is usually a form of a backdoor that allows attackers unauthorized access to the affected computer. Trojans also give cybercriminals access to the personal information of a user like IP addresses, passwords and banking details. They are often used to install keyloggers that can easily capture account names and passwords, or credit card data, and disclose it to cybercriminals. Most ransomware attacks are also usually carried out using a Trojan horse, by housing the harmful code inside an apparently harmless piece of data.
Trojans are now considered to be the most dangerous of all malware, particularly the ones that are designed to steal the financial information of a user. Some insidious types of Trojans actually claim to remove the viruses in the system, but instead introduce viruses.
Notable examples also include Trojan horses developed by governments and government agencies like the FBI, NSA, and GCHQ. Names like Magic Lantern, FinFisher, WARRIOR PRIDE, Netbus, Beast, Blackhole exploit kit, Gh0st RAT, Tiny Banker Trojan, Clickbot.A, and Zeus have been the cause of horror. While an Android malware discovered in 2015, called Shedun, is one of the many that target mobile devices.
4. Rootkits
A rootkit is a collection of software specifically designed to permit malware that gathers information, into your system. These work in the background so that a user may not notice anything suspicious. But in the background, a rootkit will permit several types of malware to get into the system.
These software work like a back door for malware to enter and wreak havoc, and are now being used extensively by hackers to infect systems. A rootkit installation can either be automatic, or an attacker can install it once they have obtained administrator privileges.
What is Riskware?
Root access in other words.
Detecting a rootkit is difficult, as this type of malware is often able to subvert the software that locates it. Removing a rootkit is equally complicated, or in some cases practically impossible — more so in cases where the rootkit resides inside the kernel of an operating system. Reinstalling the OS is often the only solution to completely get rid of such an advanced rootkit.
The first malicious rootkit to gain notoriety on Windows was NTRootkit in 1999, but the most popular is the Sony BMG copy protection rootkit scandal that rocked the company in the year 2005. Its discovery and media attention exposed users to even more serious vulnerabilities.
5. Ransomware
The most devastating type of malicious software, by some counts. Definitely one of the most advanced and constantly on the rise these days. Ransomware blocks access to the data of a victim, threating to either publish it or delete it until a ransom is paid. Worse yet, there is no guarantee that paying a ransom will return access to the data, or prevent it from deletion.
This type of malware basically infects the system from the inside, locking the computer and making it useless. Simpler ransomware may lock a system that may be difficult to reverse for most people, while the more advanced variety of ransomware encrypts the files of a victim, rendering them inaccessible, and demanding a ransom payment to decrypt the files.
Ransomware attacks initially gained popularity in Russia, but these types of scams have now grown in popularity internationally. They are typically carried out using a Trojan that comes with a payload that is disguised as a legitimate file.
Although this manner of digital extortion has been in play since late 80s, it returned to prominence in late 2013 with the advent of digital currency that is used to collect ransom money. Many security vendors classify ransomware to be the most dangerous cyber threat — its detection and removal is a complicated process. And though it is widespread on PC platforms, ransomware that target mobile operating systems has also seen a rise.
Major ransomware like Reveton, CryptoLocker, CryptoWall, and more recently, the 2017 WannaCry attack, have caused no small amount of destruction. While Fusob, one of the most widely used mobile ransomware families, has employed scare tactics to extort people to pay a ransom.
6. Keyloggers
Software that records all the information that is typed using a keyboard. Keyloggers usually are not capable of recording information that is entered using virtual keyboards and other input devices, but physical keyboards are at risk with this type of malware.
Keyloggers store the gathered information and send it to the attacker, who can then extract sensitive information like username and passwords as well as credit card details.
7. Grayware
Grayware is a recently coined term that came into use around 2004. It is used to describe unwanted applications and files that though are not classified as malware, can worsen the performance of computers and lead to security risks. At the minimum, these programs behave in an annoying or undesirable manner, and at worst, they monitor a system and phone home with information.
Grayware alludes to both adware and spyware. Almost all commercially available antivirus software can detect these potentially unwanted programs, and offer separate modules to detect, quarantine and remove malware that displays advertisements.
7a. Adware
Although ad-supported software is now much more common, and known as adware in some circles, the word has been linked to malware for quite some time. While adware can refer to any program that is supported by advertising, malicious adware usually shows ads in the form of popups and windows that cannot be closed.
It is the perhaps the most lucrative and least harmful malware, designed with the specific purpose of displaying ads on your computer. Adware usage is on the rise on mobile, in particular, with some Chinese firms bundling in adware by default in certain low-cost Android smartphones.
7b. Spyware
Spyware, as the name gives away, is software that constantly spies on you. Its main purpose is to keep track of your Internet activities in order to send adware. Spyware are also used to gather information about an organization without their knowledge, and send that information to another entity, without consent of the victim.
